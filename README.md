# Funky Forager
The silliest musicbot for Discord

This bot was made primarily for Mókus Őrs (https://discord.gg/qMHJcgdzRH) but should work on any server

This package requires you to set envorimental variables to function properly.
You can do this in any way you'd like, but the easiest is creating a `.env` file in the main directory.

Example `.env` content:
```env
DOMAIN="your.domain.name"
DISCORD_TOKEN="token here"
CLIENT_ID="your client id"
CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret"
SERVER_ID="your server id"
PORT=6065
```

It is also recommended that you set up cookie files with the netscape format.
File names should follow this format: `cookies*.txt` where the star is a wildcard and can be anything
