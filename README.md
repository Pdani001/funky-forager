This package requires you to set envorimental variables to function properly.
You can do this in any way you'd like, but the easiest is creating a `.env` file in the main directory.

Example `.env` content:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN="token here"
CLIENT_ID="your client id"
CLIENT_SECRET="your client secret"
SERVER_ID="your server id"
PORT=6065
```
